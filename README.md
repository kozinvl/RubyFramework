Using Cucumber, SitePrism, Capybara

Cucumber
---------

Cucumber is a software tool used by computer programmers for testing other software. 
It runs automated acceptance tests in a behavior-driven development (BDD) style. 
Central to the Cucumber BDD approach is its plain language parser called Gherkin.

SitePrism
---------

A Page Object Model DSL for Capybara

SitePrism gives you a simple, clean, and semantic DSL for describing your site using the Page Object Model pattern, for use with Capybara in automated acceptance testing.

Find the pretty documentation here: http://rdoc.info/gems/site_prism/frames

Capybara
--------

Capybara helps you test web applications by simulating how a real user would interact with your app. 
It is agnostic about the driver running your tests and comes with Rack::Test and Selenium support built in. 
WebKit is supported through an external gem.
